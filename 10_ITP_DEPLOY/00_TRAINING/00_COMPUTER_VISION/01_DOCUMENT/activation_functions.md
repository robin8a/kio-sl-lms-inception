1. **Sigmoid Function**: The sigmoid function is a classic activation function that squashes the input values into a range between 0 and 1. It's smooth and differentiable, making it useful in binary classification tasks. However, it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become very small for extreme input values, leading to slow learning.

2. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: ReLU is a simple and widely used activation function that returns the input value if it's positive, otherwise, it returns zero. It introduces non-linearity to the model and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. ReLU is computationally efficient but can suffer from the "dying ReLU" problem, where neurons may become inactive and stop learning due to consistently outputting zero for negative inputs.

3. **Leaky ReLU**: Leaky ReLU is a variation of ReLU that allows a small, positive slope for negative inputs instead of setting them to zero. This addresses the dying ReLU problem by ensuring all neurons contribute to the learning process, even those with negative inputs. It's simple yet effective in preventing the saturation of gradients.

4. **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**: ELU is another variation of ReLU that smoothens the negative part of the function with an exponential curve. It helps mitigate the dying ReLU problem and has been shown to accelerate learning compared to traditional ReLU. However, ELU is computationally more expensive due to the exponential operation.

5. **Tanh Function**: The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function is similar to the sigmoid function but ranges between -1 and 1. Like sigmoid, it's useful in binary classification tasks and helps introduce non-linearity to the model. However, it suffers from the same vanishing gradient problem as the sigmoid function.

6. **Softmax Function**: Softmax is often used as the activation function in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It normalizes the output into a probability distribution over multiple classes, with each output representing the probability of the corresponding class. It's widely used in classification tasks due to its ability to provide interpretable outputs.

7. **Swish Function**: Swish is a relatively newer activation function that combines elements of ReLU and sigmoid functions. It tends to perform better than ReLU on deeper models and has a smoother gradient, potentially leading to faster convergence during training. However, it's computationally more expensive than ReLU.

These activation functions play crucial roles in deep learning models by introducing non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. The choice of activation function depends on the specific characteristics of the problem and the architecture of the neural network being used.
